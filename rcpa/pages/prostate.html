<h1>Prostate Report</h1>

<p>
This implementation guide is developed from the Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia's (RCPA) "Prostate Cancer (Radical Prostatectomy) - 
Structured Reporting Protocol" (2nd edition 2014). There are separate protocols for core (needle) biopsies and transurethral resection (TUR) specimens.
</p>
<p>
Structured reporting aims to improve the completeness and usability of pathology reports for clinicians, and improve decision support for cancer treatment. 
The protocol provides the framework for the reporting of any prostate (radical prostectomy) cancer, whether as a minimum data set or fully comprehensive 
report. The prostate (radical prostectomy) cancer protocol is based on information contained within multiple international publications and datasets 
and has been developed in consultation with local practising pathologists, oncologists, surgeons, radiologists and interested national bodies.
</p>
<p>
This implementation guide is developed as part of RCPA's PITUS 15-16 working group 5 project - Report Modelling.
